### Supervised Learning vs. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning has two key attributes - **Clustering** and **Dimensionality Reduction**

### Dimenstionality Reduction 
Objective is called - **Reward** to an **agent** who takes action to adapt to learn from the **Environment**

## Lab

- The notebook instance itself does not need a high computing resource. Attach Elastic Inference if more GPU is needed
- Use Conda Python 3 notebook to use XG Boost algorithm
- Jupyter Lab commands shortcuts
    - A - adds a shell above current row
    - B - adds a shell below
    - Enter - goes to the selected shell
    - Shift + Enter - runs and goes to next shell
    - Ctrl + Enter - runs and stays at the same shell
